## tl;dr

This post summarizes the Pythonic concept of interface, mainly by taking notes from the chapter 11 of the book "Fluent Python".

## duck typing and Python protocols

> In the context of Object Oriented Programming, a protocol is an informal interface, defined only in documentation and not in code. For example, the sequence protocol in Python entails just the `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods. Any class `Spam` that implements those methods with the standard signature and semantics can be used anywhere a sequence is expected. Whether `Spam` is a subclass of this or that is irrelevant, all that matters is that it provides the necessary methods.

The following example shows how the sequence protocol works. `SequenceLikeClass` implements the sequence protocol by duck typing: to equip with special methods `__len__` and `__getitem__`, which are methods corresponding to the sequence protocol.

```python
class SequenceLikeClass:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.sequence = list(items)
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.sequence)
    def __getitem__(self, position):
        return self.sequence[position]
```

Although it does not inherit from sequence class like list, it behaves well like some sequence class.

```python
# instantiate
>>> seq = SequenceLikeClass(range(5))
# len works
>>> len(seq)
5
# getting an item through index
>>> seq[2]
2
# negative index supported
>>> seq[-1]
4
# slicing works
>>> seq[2:4]
[2, 3]

# for loop works even if it does not have __iter__ method
>>> for j in seq: print(j)
0
1
2
3
4

# in operator works even if it does not have __contains__
>>> 1 in seq
True

# choice requires sequence as an argument, it naturally works
>>> from random import choice
>>> choice(seq)
1 # randomly chosen among 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4
```

## goose typing and ABCs (abstract base classes)

ABCs makes protocols explicit.

> Abstract base classes complement duck-typing by providing a way to define interfaces when other techniques like hasattr() would be clumsy or subtly wrong (for example with magic methods). ABCs introduce virtual subclasses, which are classes that donâ€™t inherit from a class but are still recognized by isinstance() and issubclass()

> What goose typing means is: `isinstance(obj, cls)` is now just fine... as long as `cls` is an Abstract Base Class.

```python
from collections.abc import Sized  # Sized needs __len__
class SizedClass(Sized):
    def __init__(self):
        print('hello')

>>> sc = SizedClass()  # without __len__, Python gives us an error when instantiating, not importing
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class SizedClass with abstract methods __len__


class RealSizedClass(Sized):  # let's redefine
    def __len__(self):
        return 2

>>> rsc = RealSizedClass()
>>> isinstance(rsc, Sized)
True  # of course

@Sized.register  # register decorator allows us to do goose typing
class BearSizedClass:  # merely an object with __len__ method
    def __len__(self):
        return 2

>>> bsc = BearSizedClass()
>>> isinstance(bsc, Sized)
True  # actually, it is also true without the decorator...
# why? check the book. (abc.Sized has __subclasshook__ implemented)
```
